# CENCIVIC BLOG REPO

> link : https://kyungbin.im

A personal blog built with Next.js that transforms Obsidian markdown notes into a web publication. Inspired by Steve Jobs' "connecting the dots" philosophy, this blog serves as a personal knowledge base where thoughts and ideas are interconnected.

## Features

- **Markdown-based**: Write posts in Obsidian and sync them to AWS S3
- **Minimal workflow**: Markdown → S3 → Web rendering pipeline
- **Search**: Full-text search powered by Meilisearch => manually
- **Code highlighting**: Syntax highlighting for code blocks using highlight.js
- **Table of contents**: Auto-generated TOC for better navigation

### Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- AWS S3 (content storage)
- Meilisearch (search engine) =>
- Marked (markdown parser)

## TODO

- search engine change
- rust markdown parser
